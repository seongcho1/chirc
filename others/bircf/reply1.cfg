#         - When sending a TOPIC message to determine the

#           a server is required to send the list back using the
#           RPL_INVITELIST and RPL_ENDOFINVITELIST messages.  A
#           separate RPL_INVITELIST is sent for each active mask.
#           After the masks have been listed (or if none present) a

#           The <version> is the version of the software being
#           used (including any patchlevel revisions) and the
#           <debuglevel> is used to indicate if the server is

       315    RPL_ENDOFWHO
              "<name> :End of WHO list"

#         - The RPL_WHOREPLY and RPL_ENDOFWHO pair are used
#           to answer a WHO message.  The RPL_WHOREPLY is only
#           sent if there is an appropriate match to the WHO
#           query.  If there is a list of parameters supplied
#           with a WHO message, a RPL_ENDOFWHO MUST be sent
#           after processing each list item with <name> being
#           the item.

       353    RPL_NAMREPLY
              "( "=" / "*" / "@" ) <channel>
               :[ "@" / "+" ] <nick> *( " " [ "@" / "+" ] <nick> )
#         - "@" is used for secret channels, "*" for private
#           channels, and "=" for others (public channels).

       366    RPL_ENDOFNAMES
              "<channel> :End of NAMES list"

#         - To reply to a NAMES message, a reply pair consisting
#           of RPL_NAMREPLY and RPL_ENDOFNAMES is sent by the
#           server back to the client.  If there is no channel
#           found as in the query, then only RPL_ENDOFNAMES is
#           returned.  The exception to this is when a NAMES
#           message is sent with no parameters and all visible
#           channels and contents are sent back in a series of
#           RPL_NAMEREPLY messages with a RPL_ENDOFNAMES to mark
#           the end.

#           RPL_BANLIST is sent for each active banmask.  After the
#           banmasks have been listed (or if none present) a
#           RPL_ENDOFBANLIST MUST be sent.

              ":End of MOTD command"

#         - When responding to the MOTD message and the MOTD file
#           is found, the file is displayed line by line, with
#           each line no longer than 80 characters, using
#           RPL_MOTD format replies.  These MUST be surrounded
#           by a RPL_MOTDSTART (before the RPL_MOTDs) and an
#           RPL_ENDOFMOTD (after).

       381    RPL_YOUREOPER
              ":You are now an IRC operator"

#           just successfully issued an OPER message and gained
#           operator status.

       382    RPL_REHASHING
              "<config file> :Rehashing"

#           registration.

       391    RPL_TIME
              "<server> :<string showing server's local time>"

#         - When replying to the TIME message, a server MUST send
#           the reply using the RPL_TIME format above.  The string
#           showing the time need only contain the correct day and
#           time there.  There is no further requirement for the
#           time string.

       392    RPL_USERSSTART
              ":UserID   Terminal  Host"
       393    RPL_USERS

       395    RPL_NOUSERS
              ":Nobody logged in"

#         - If the USERS message is handled by a server, the
#           replies RPL_USERSTART, RPL_USERS, RPL_ENDOFUSERS and
#           RPL_NOUSERS are used.  RPL_USERSSTART MUST be sent
#           first, following by either a sequence of RPL_USERS
#           or a single RPL_NOUSER.  Following this is
#           RPL_ENDOFUSERS.

#         - The RPL_TRACE* are all returned by the server in

#           returned is dependent on the TRACE message and
#           whether it was sent by an operator or not.  There

#           Replies RPL_TRACEUNKNOWN, RPL_TRACECONNECTING and

#           response to a TRACE command traversing the IRC
#           network should reflect the actual connectivity of
#           the servers themselves along that path.
#           RPL_TRACENEWTYPE is to be used for any connection
#           which does not fit in the other categories but is
#           being displayed anyway.
#           RPL_TRACEEND is sent to indicate the end of the list.

       235    RPL_SERVLISTEND
              "<mask> <type> :End of service listing"

#         - When listing services in reply to a SERVLIST message,
#           a server is required to send the list back using the
#           RPL_SERVLIST and RPL_SERVLISTEND messages.  A separate
#           RPL_SERVLIST is sent for each service.  After the
#           services have been listed (or if none present) a
#           RPL_SERVLISTEND MUST be sent.

       251    RPL_LUSERCLIENT

              ":I have <integer> clients and <integer>
                servers"

#         - In processing an LUSERS message, the server
#           sends a set of replies from RPL_LUSERCLIENT,
#           RPL_LUSEROP, RPL_USERUNKNOWN,
#           RPL_LUSERCHANNELS and RPL_LUSERME.  When
#           replying, a server MUST send back
#           RPL_LUSERCLIENT and RPL_LUSERME.  The other
#           replies are only sent back if a non-zero count
#           is found for them.

              ":<admin info>"
       259    RPL_ADMINEMAIL
              ":<admin info>"

#         - When replying to an ADMIN message, a server
#           is expected to use replies RPL_ADMINME
#           through to RPL_ADMINEMAIL and provide a text
#           message with each.  For RPL_ADMINLOC1 a
#           description of what city, state and country
#           the server is in is expected, followed by
#           details of the institution (RPL_ADMINLOC2)
#           and finally the administrative contact for the
#           server (an email address here is REQUIRED)
#           in RPL_ADMINEMAIL.

       263    RPL_TRYAGAIN
              "<command> :Please wait a while and try again."

         - When a server drops a command without processing it,
