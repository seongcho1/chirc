              "<server> :<string showing server's local time>"

#         - When replying to the TIME message, a server MUST send
#           the reply using the RPL_TIME format above.  The string
#           showing the time need only contain the correct day and
#           time there.  There is no further requirement for the
#           time string.

#         - If the USERS message is handled by a server, the
#           replies RPL_USERSTART, RPL_USERS, RPL_ENDOFUSERS and
#           RPL_NOUSERS are used.  RPL_USERSSTART MUST be sent
#           first, following by either a sequence of RPL_USERS
#           or a single RPL_NOUSER.  Following this is
#           RPL_ENDOFUSERS.

#         - The RPL_TRACE* are all returned by the server in
#           response to the TRACE message.  How many are
#           returned is dependent on the TRACE message and
#           whether it was sent by an operator or not.  There
#           is no predefined order for which occurs first.
#           Replies RPL_TRACEUNKNOWN, RPL_TRACECONNECTING and
#           RPL_TRACEHANDSHAKE are all used for connections
#           which have not been fully established and are either
#           unknown, still attempting to connect or in the
#           process of completing the 'server handshake'.
#           RPL_TRACELINK is sent by any server which handles

#           response to a TRACE command traversing the IRC
#           network should reflect the actual connectivity of
#           the servers themselves along that path.
#           RPL_TRACENEWTYPE is to be used for any connection
#           which does not fit in the other categories but is
#           being displayed anyway.
#           RPL_TRACEEND is sent to indicate the end of the list.

       235    RPL_SERVLISTEND
              "<mask> <type> :End of service listing"

#         - When listing services in reply to a SERVLIST message,
#           a server is required to send the list back using the
#           RPL_SERVLIST and RPL_SERVLISTEND messages.  A separate
#           RPL_SERVLIST is sent for each service.  After the
#           services have been listed (or if none present) a
#           RPL_SERVLISTEND MUST be sent.

       251    RPL_LUSERCLIENT
              ":There are <integer> users and <integer>
               services on <integer> servers"

              "<integer> :channels formed"
       255    RPL_LUSERME
              ":I have <integer> clients and <integer>
                servers"

#         - In processing an LUSERS message, the server
#           sends a set of replies from RPL_LUSERCLIENT,
#           RPL_LUSEROP, RPL_USERUNKNOWN,
#           RPL_LUSERCHANNELS and RPL_LUSERME.  When
#           replying, a server MUST send back
#           RPL_LUSERCLIENT and RPL_LUSERME.  The other
#           replies are only sent back if a non-zero count
#           is found for them.

       256    RPL_ADMINME
              "<server> :Administrative info"
       257    RPL_ADMINLOC1
              ":<admin info>"
       258    RPL_ADMINLOC2
              ":<admin info>"
       259    RPL_ADMINEMAIL
              ":<admin info>"

#         - When replying to an ADMIN message, a server
#           is expected to use replies RPL_ADMINME
#           through to RPL_ADMINEMAIL and provide a text
#           message with each.  For RPL_ADMINLOC1 a
#           description of what city, state and country
#           the server is in is expected, followed by
#           details of the institution (RPL_ADMINLOC2)
#           and finally the administrative contact for the
#           server (an email address here is REQUIRED)
#           in RPL_ADMINEMAIL.

       263    RPL_TRYAGAIN
              "<command> :Please wait a while and try again."

         - When a server drops a command without processing it,
           it MUST use the reply RPL_TRYAGAIN to inform the
           originating client.
